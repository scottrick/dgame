DEBUG SCENE (F10):
This is a special fullscreen debug screen.  There are two main differences from the other scenes.  You can drag the Mouse + LEFT_CLICK to manually rotate the model / texture.  You can also use '[' and ']' to zoom in and out.  As usual, '-'/'+' are used to change through all the models.

I think that's all the controls.  I will try to update this file when I change or add new controls.
